title: Chess Retro
---

I usually do a lot of things. But unfortunately, I don't remember what happens. I, lazily, rely on my unconscious. This aspect about myself makes it really hard for me to contribute to the content of conversations, by the way. Not only that but also, I feel that I'm plateauing at skills which I'd like to get better at. The point of this retro is to take some time to reflect, study what I've done, and analyze my mistakes so I don't repeat them.

I've missed quite a few chess puzzles recently. In summary:
- I miscalculated because I thought a piece was still on its original starting square but it moved in the middle of my calculations
- I missed a simple exchange that was losing for me
- I focused on a sacrifice and a knight-queen fork but missed at the end of the tactic, I would actually be down in material
- I missed a perpetual because I thought I had a defense against it but it actually dropped a piece due to a queen fork
- I missed considering a move because I saw another complex line but that line just ends in a draw
- I wasn't able to see a move because I was too concentrated on checks that didn't work and trying to capture a hanging piece. But I needed to ignore the hanging piece and reinforce the threat of the check
- I didn't see a tricky defense in the endgame that stopped promotion

Because of these oversights, I would not see any winning lines when in fact, one of them was actually winning but I thought it was losing due to a miscalculation. And when I'd recalculate the position again, I'd make the same mistake or skip over recalculating it because there were more pertinent parts of the line. This'd cause me to be stuck. However, in a couple cases, I just didn't see my followup after a strong reply from the opponent.

The more technical aspects of my oversights are in [puzzle one](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/106589), my thought process was 1. Nf6+ gxf6 2. Rxh8 Kxh8 3. Qh2+. At this point, I saw Bh3 Qxh3 Qxh3 Nxh3 Nxf3 and this looked losing for white. So I also saw 1. fxg4 Qxg4 2. Nf6+ gxf6 3. Rxh8 Kxh8 4. Qf2+ Kh7 but here I didn't see Qxf7#. I bet I must've missed it because I thought the pawn was still on g7, but it wasn't after 2. So I calculated 5. Qh8+ Ke7 6. Qxf6+ Kd7 7. Qxf7+ Kc6 and this looked pretty lost. So I looked at other alternatives, like 1. Qxd4. But 1. Qxd4 Rxh5 2. Rxh5 Bxh5 gives black at least equality. And I also looked at 1. fxg4 Qxg4 2. Qf4. I missed that just 2. Qxf4 3. Nxf4 4. Rxh1 is bad for white in this line, and I calculated 2. Qd1+ 3. Kg2 Qc1+ 4. Qf2 (if Kg3 there would be the nasty Ne2 fork). I thought Qf4 was nice because it was threatening Qxf7+. Too bad it was based on a hallucination. In addition, I also calculated 1. Qf4 but Qc4+ or even Be6 looks fine for black. In this puzzle, I discarded the valid line because I couldn't see mate, and I missed an exchange that made the line I thought was winning losing.

That took way too long to write so I'm just going to quickly summarize my mistakes now. In [puzzle two](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/61408), I miscounted, and I thought Qxb7+ with the idea of Ne6+ was good, but after all the trades, it's actually losing. I also didn't see the first move, Rb5.

In [puzzle three](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/150650), I missed a perpetual. I thought g5 would trap the black knight, and I foresaw Ne4+ Qxe4 Qf1+ Kg6 Qxf7+ Kxh6 Qf6+. I thought I had Qg6 stopping the perpetual but actually, black can just take on h8, so there is actually a perpetual.

In [puzzle four](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/208556000), I calculated a critical line that appeared winning for white, Qd7 Nb7 Rxb6 Rxd7 bxc3 Kxb6 Re5 but I missed an even better move Nb6+ after Nb7. Instead, I hallucinated on Re7 Kb8 Re8+. 

In [puzzle five](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/106707), I saw Nxd5 but after Qd8 I couldn't see Rd1. I was stuck too much on Qxc4 or Rxc4 or e6.

In [puzzle six](https://chesstempo.com/chess-problems/91100), I saw c4 but didn't see after Kc3 c3 there was Nd4, a nice defense, preventing c2. So after Kc3, I needed to play a6. 

In my next chess study, I need to retro my past games and try to find common patterns.
