Hello world. It is March 16 2025, 4:55 PM PST.

When I'm bored, I like to artificially stimulate my feelings. If something unfair happened to me recently, the choice of feeling might be sadness. But usually, it's ambition. Ambition causes me to act with purpose. And this is important since life is about accomplishing great things. However, I didn't have a way of reliably stirring and being aware that I was attempting it. Until now!

Hey, it's me from the past.

- I believe in you.
- You can do it.
- Don't let me down.
